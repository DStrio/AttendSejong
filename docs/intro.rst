About the Project
------------------

Currently, Sejong University students face challenges in tracking their online class attendance and assignment deadlines within the Jiphyeon campus(e-campus) system. There is a lack of notifications to alert students about their online class attendance and pending assignments. Also, students do not receive timely updates on announcements posted by their professors. This inconvenience has led to a need for an application that provides a solution.
To ensure the uniqueness of our project, we have conducted research on platforms such as GitHub and freshcode.club, as well as reviewed several sources and projects. Our findings indicate that there is no existing solution that comprehensively addresses this problem.

- Check assignments for online lectures in the Giphyun Campus
